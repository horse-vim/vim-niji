This would be a fork but the original maintainer seems to have pulled it from github.

Niji (Rainbow) is yet another rainbow parentheses plugin for Vim. It’s good for
Common Lisp, Scheme and Clojure — with two colour schemes — out-of-the-box.
Just install, and you’re good to go. The filetypes, matching characters and
colours Niji uses are completely configurable (See `:help niji-configuration`
for details).
