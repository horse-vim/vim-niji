*niji.txt*                              Yet another rainbow parentheses plugin

FRONT MATTER                                             *niji-front-matter*

                 This would be a fork but the plugin was pulled from github

CONFIGURATION                                           *niji-configuration*

‘g:loaded_niji’                                              *'loaded_niji'*

To disable Niji, just define this variable, for example:
>
    let g:loaded_niji = 1
<

‘g:niji_matching_filetypes’                      *'niji_matching_filetypes'*

By default, Niji gives you rainbow parentheses for the following three
|FileType|’s:

    1. `lisp`
    2. `scheme`
    3. `clojure`

You can override this setting by defining your own, for example:
>
    let g:niji_matching_filetypes = ['lisp', 'ruby', 'python']
<

‘g:niji_matching_characters’                    *'niji_matching_characters'*

By default, Niji gives you rainbow highlighting for the following three sets
of characters:

    1. Parentheses: ‘(’ & ‘)’
    2. Brackets: ‘[’ & ‘]’
    3. Braces: ‘{’ & ‘}’

You can override this setting by defining your own, for example:
>
    let g:niji_matching_characters = [['(', ')'],
                                    \ ['\[', '\]'],
                                    \ ['<', '>']]
<

Note that you need to backslash escape square brackets (‘[’ and ‘]’).


‘g:niji_dark_colours’ &                                *'niji_dark_colours'*
‘g:niji_light_colours’                                *'niji_light_colours'*

By default, Niji chooses between two sets of 10 colours -- based on whether
your `colorscheme` uses a dark or light background, and with support for both
terminal and graphical variants of Vim (such as Gvim or MacVim) -- which match
those of Vim‘s built-in Lisp syntax file. You can override these by defining
your own list of colours, for example:
>
    let g:niji_dark_colours = [['brown', 'RoyalBlue3'],
                            \ ['Darkblue', 'SeaGreen3'],
                            \ ['darkgray', 'DarkOrchid3'],
                            \ ['darkgreen', 'firebrick3'],
                            \ ['darkcyan', 'RoyalBlue3']]
<

Note that your outer-most parenthesis colour comes first, and the inner-most
parenthesis colour comes last.

You can define as few or as many as you like, and Niji will cycle through each
of them as the nesting of your expressions increases.

If you want to use the same colours for both light and dark backgrounds, you
could do the following:
>
    let g:niji_dark_colours = [['brown', 'RoyalBlue3'],
                             \ ['DarkBlue', 'SeaGreen3']]
    let g:niji_light_colours = g:niji_dark_colours
<

Note the British spelling of ‘colour’.


‘g:niji_use_legacy_colours’                      *'niji_use_legacy_colours'*

Let this variable to use the colour scheme available in the rainbow
parentheses scripts by ‘kien’, Martin Krischik, Luc Hermitte and John Gilmore.
>
    let g:niji_use_legacy_colours = 1
<

Note the British spelling of ‘colour’.
